# 100 DAYS OF ML

## Day 0: August 24, 2018
**Today's Progress:**
**1.** Studied Keras from a book: "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Cholet. 
**2.** Read an article titled 7 steps to learning Keras: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/10/seven-steps-deep-learning-keras.html
**3.** Watched a video on Keras: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrkYu2zVUyM 

**Thoughts:**
I am beginning to grasp the function class / Model class. See this documentation for more info:

## Day 1: August 25, 2018
**Today's Progress:**
**1.** Studied Keras from a book: "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Cholet. Today I finished reading the last chapter.
**2.** Watched a more recent video on Keras: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBIA6Wcu2j4


**Thoughts:**
Today I learned about the implementation of 'temperature' in a RNN/LSTM. I was pleased to learn that keras functionality is low enough level to accomplish a dynamic temperature. My hope is to reproduce (in keras) the results of this blog:
